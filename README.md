## Problem 
Cultural tourism accounts for about 40% of global tourism revenue, equivalent to 2019 USD 586 billion. However, most of the creators of intangible cultural heritage earn quite low income. It is estimated that in the same year 75% of workers in the cultural and creative industry earned less than USD 900 per month, 50% less than USD 400 and 29% less than USD 250.

Who: Artisans, musicians, singers, dancers, practitioners of natural and universal activities, other creators and communities for the reduction of the preservation of intangible cultural heritage and a sustainable economy.

Why: A. Ignorance of many local and foreign tourists of the multiple value of cultural manifestations, B. Difficulty for tourists to connect in real time with cultural manifestations, C. Fear of loss, theft or breakage of the crafts, D. Distrust of the artistic, historical and ecological value of cultural manifestations and E. Few digital alternatives to consume or support.

## What is does
Huellay is a web3 social network that aims to physically and digitally connect creators and tourists for sustainable development. It achieves this mainly through the location by map of all the creators and tourists who are currently executing and searching for cultural manifestations, the creation and commercialization of digital cultural heritage with high cultural value, and statistics on how we are doing with sustainable development. This is possible with blockchain solutions from Polygon, Filecoin, Celo and Blockdaemon by significantly improving trust, enabling fast and secure transactions, creating unique digital assets and executing smart contracts.

## What we learned
We learned how to interact with the Polygon network and create a plugin for open-source software.

## How we built it
The app is built with Android Studio, Kotlin, and the web3.js library. The web app interacts with a solidity smart contract deployed to mumbai.polygonscan.com testnet.
